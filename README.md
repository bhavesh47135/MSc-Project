# MSc-Project

This repository contains the files relevant to my MSc Cyber Security Individual Project, where I created a decentralised platform for users to store IPFS hashes of files which are displayed on the platform. Essentially allowing users to distribute files in a decentralised manner which is resistant to censorship.
